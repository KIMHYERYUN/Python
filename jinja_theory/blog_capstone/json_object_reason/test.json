I figured out that something absurd happened,' Yoon told reporters referring to the incident. 'Police released the list of their own recommendations for the reshuffle, which had yet to be confirmed because it required approval first from the interior ministry and then the president. This is nonsense and equivalent to a disturbance of national discipline as the draft of the list was released.'",

The city government has set up a task force committee for the new slogan project and plans to unveil it no later than the year's end. The new slogan will go into use next year. According to its spokesperson, Wednesday, there has been a consensus among city government officials that the current brand I.Seoul.U is not appealing or competitive enough to draw the attention of international travelers and foreign investors, compared to those of other global cities such as New York or Amsterdam. I.Seoul.U has been the capital's slogan for years since being selected through a public contest in 2015.",
